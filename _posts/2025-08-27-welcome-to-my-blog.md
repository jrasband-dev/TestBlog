This is my very first blog post! ðŸš€  

Iâ€™m building this site with **GitHub Pages** and **Jekyll**. The setup was surprisingly easy:

1. Create a GitHub repo named `username.github.io`.
2. Add Jekyll config files and posts in Markdown.
3. Commit â†’ push â†’ and itâ€™s live!

Iâ€™ll be writing about:
- Coding experiments ðŸ’»
- Projects Iâ€™m working on ðŸ”¨
- Random thoughts â˜•

Thanks for stopping by â€” more posts soon!
